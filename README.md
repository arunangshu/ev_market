<i>**Abstract**</i>

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market to identify a feasible entry strategy for a new startup. Leveraging segmentation analysis of vehicle registration, sales, and charging infrastructure data, this study pinpoints the most promising opportunities for market entry. The analysis reveals a significant growth differential between vehicle categories, with the personal four-wheeler and passenger three-wheeler (erickshaw) segments demonstrating the highest potential. In contrast, the two-wheeler EV market shows signs of saturation. Two primary strategic pathways emerge from the analysis. The first is a lower-capital, mass-market approach focused on the rapidly growing e-rickshaw segment in high-demand states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, and Delhi. The second is a higher-capital, technology-focused strategy targeting the exponential growth in the personal four-wheeler market in infrastructure-rich states such as Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. The report concludes by recommending a strategic choice based on the startup's capital reserves, technological capabilities, and risk appetite, while outlining target customer profiles and pricing strategies for each segment.
